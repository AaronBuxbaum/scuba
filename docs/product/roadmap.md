# Roadmap

Sequencing guidance, not a contract. Each milestone ships a usable vertical slice. Re-order only
with a note here explaining why.

## M0 — Foundation ✅ (this PR)

Tooling, docs, agent layer, CI, design tokens. Everything after this leans on it.

## M1 — Spine: domain model, database, auth (in progress)

- ✅ Database + ORM chosen and ADR'd ([0005](../architecture/decisions/0005-database.md):
  Drizzle + Postgres, PGlite in dev/test with auto-migrate/auto-seed).
- ✅ Core entities: shop, person (with roles), trip, booking — multi-tenant (`shop_id`
  everywhere). Demo shop seed data; `/trips` schedule page as the first data-backed surface.
- ✅ Auth chosen and ADR'd ([0006](../architecture/decisions/0006-auth.md): Auth.js v5
  credentials + JWT, edge-safe proxy split). Staff sign-in live; protected `/shop` dashboard.
- ⬜ Hosting: choose and ADR when something needs deploying.

## M2 — Bookings (core complete)

- ✅ Shop-side: staff schedule trips (`/shop/trips/new` — local-time entry converted via
  `src/lib/zoned.ts`, capacity, validation, success moment on `/shop`).
- ✅ Shop-side: manage trips (`/shop/trips/[id]` — edit details, cancel/reinstate, crew
  assignment via `trip_assignments`, diver roster with booking cancel).
- ✅ Diver-side: public booking flow (`/trips/[id]` — no account, name + email, transactional
  capacity enforcement in `src/db/bookings.ts`, confirmation moment, sold-out/past states).
- ⬜ Courses: deferred until cert levels and DSD rules exist (M4) — a course session without
  prerequisite gating is just a trip, and shops can schedule it as one meanwhile.
- ⬜ Booking notifications (email confirmations) — arrives with M7 notifications.

## M3 — Waivers (first slice shipped)

- ✅ Versioned waiver templates + per-booking signed waivers
  ([`schema.ts`](../../src/db/schema.ts): `waiver_templates`, `waivers`; ADR
  [20260718-waiver-signatures](../architecture/decisions/20260718-waiver-signatures.md): typed-name
  signature, immutable signed records, token completion links).
- ✅ Pre-arrival signing flow: booking auto-issues a secure, expiring link; diver signs the release +
  medical statement at `/waiver/[token]`; fail-closed physician-referral state. Framework-free rules
  in [`src/lib/waivers.ts`](../../src/lib/waivers.ts); idempotent, transactional submission in
  [`src/db/waivers.ts`](../../src/db/waivers.ts).
- ✅ Staff readiness: `/shop/trips/[id]` roster shows per-diver waiver status and a copy/send link;
  diver confirmation on `/trips/[id]` surfaces the next step.
- ⬜ Follow-ups (see [waivers-open-decisions.md](waivers-open-decisions.md)): staff template
  authoring/versioning UI, resume/re-send UX, medical-answer privacy at rest (with hosting ADR),
  signed-PDF export, and a shared readiness model that M4 will generalize.

## M4 — Cert checks

- Card capture (photo + fields), verification workflow, requirements on trips/sites,
  "ready to board" status roll-up (waiver + cert + payment later).

## M5 — Gear

- Inventory with sizes and service state, assignment to bookings, service logging.

## M6 — Boat manifests

- Manifest view per trip, roll-call mode (big targets, offline-tolerant, works in sunlight),
  print/PDF export. The safety-critical milestone — domain review required.

## M7+ — Later

Payments/deposits, notifications (email/SMS), reporting, nitrox fill logs, multi-boat/multi-shop.

## Standing rule

If a milestone's slice can't be demoed in the browser, it isn't done. Every milestone ends with a
design review against [design/principles.md](../design/principles.md).
